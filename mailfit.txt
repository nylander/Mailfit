SYNOPSIS
    mailfit.pl
    [--modeltest][--email][--sendto=*user@domain*][--help][--version][--man]
    FILE

DESCRIPTION
    Runs PAUP* and MrModeltest2 (or Modeltest) on FILE, and then
    (optionally) sends the result via e-mail.

    FILE should be DNA sequences in Nexus format.

    The results from MrModeltest2 or Modeltest are written to a file named
    FILE.mfit.out, and a log file is written to FILE.mfit.log.

OPTIONS
    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too

    -mo, --modeltest
            Use Modeltest and not MrModeltest2 (MrModeltest2 is the
            default). Basically tests 56 models instead of 24.

    -e, --email
            Send the result via e-mail to the users standard UNIX account.

    -s, --sendto=*name@domain*
            Send the result via e-mail to *name@domain*.

    -h, --help
            Prints help message and exits.

    -v, --version
            Prints version message and exits.

    -ma, --man
            Displays the manual page.

USAGE
    Run Modeltest (and not MrModeltest2) and send the results to my UNIX
    e-mail account:

    mailfit.pl --modeltest --email FILE
    mailfit.pl -mo -e FILE

    Run MrModeltest2 (and not Modeltest) and send the result to *bob@home*:

    mailfit.pl --sendto=*bob@home* FILE
    mailfit.pl -s=*bob@home* FILE

    To run MrModeltest2 on FILE locally, without sending any e-mails:

    mailfit.pl FILE

REPORTING BUGS
    Please report any bugs to *nylander @ scs.fsu.edu*.

DEPENDENCIES
    PAUP*
    MrModeltest2 or Modeltest
    mutt or mail

    Minimally, PAUP* and MrModeltest2 and/or Modeltest needs to be installed
    (*and named* paup, mrmodeltest2, modeltest). In order for results to be
    send via e-mail, the user must have a e-mail account on the server where
    the job is launched. Mailfit.pl tries to use mutt, then mail as mail
    clients. No e-mails are send if none of these programs are found on the
    server.

    Note that the success of the e-mail functionality is heavily dependent
    on how the system is configured, and mailfit.pl does not do extensive
    error checking!
